You will be asked to create a DATA2060 conda environment. We recommend that you use conda but if you are more familiar with other package managers (like docker, homebrew, poetry), feel free to use those. However, please note that the TAs might not be able to help if you do not use conda. The most important thing is to install the packages with their versions as shown in the data2060.yml file of the [course's github repository](https://github.com/BrownDSI/DATA2060-Fall2023). \n",

By the end of this assignment, you will have used numpy to perform efficient computations, loaded standard datasets using sklearn, and used matplotlib to visualize several performance metrics you will be using this semester. This homework will also get you familiar with the hand-in process for jupyter notebooks."
